# Files

A small file explorer that I've been building for a couple of days. It is just a project I made for fun in my spare time.

This is just a showcase; the source code will be attached at a later date.

The textures used in the application were found online and have simply been used for the development process.

* Key input
  * Arrow keys for moving around
  * ALT + arrow keys for navigating directories
  * Open selected file or directory using ENTER
* Cursor input
  * Left click to select; double click to open
  * Mouse button four and five (if you have extra buttons) for navigation
  * Middle click to begin auto-scrolling (scroll by moving the cursor)
