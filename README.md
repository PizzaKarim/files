# Files

A small file explorer that I've been building for a couple of days for fun during my spare time.

The textures used in the application were found online and have simply been used for the development process.

You can try the application on a Windows device by downloading it from [Releases](https://github.com/PizzaKarim/files/releases).

Note: The project is far from done, and to be honest, I'd probably want to rewrite it at some point.

* Key input
  * Arrow keys for moving around
  * ALT + arrow keys for navigating directories
  * Open selected file or directory using ENTER
